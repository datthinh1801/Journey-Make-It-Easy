The building contains items of original furniture transported from the Dr Yersin Museum in Nha Trang, and reproductions of several period photographs. Entrance fee to the historical site is 30,000 dong. On site parking is free.Also on site are: an open sided canteen, and five small chalets for rent at 500,000 dong per night per couple (100,000 dong per additional guest). Electricity is available, but as yet is inexplicably not connected. Hence (1) the canteen menu is limited to dried fish, dried squid and fresh chicken, killed just for you. Tea, coffee, soft drinks and non-refigerated beer are available without ice; (2) the chalets are unheated and without hot water; and (3) small kerosene hurrican lamps are used for lighting.To get here, go 17km from Nha Trang towards Saigon, turn right at Suoi Cat commune at a blue and white tourist sign \"Ho Chua Nuoc Suoi Dau\", after one km and turn left a market onto the Hon Ba road. Follow this road 38km to Hon Ba peak.A visit to this site would suit history buffs and those just wishing an escape from summer heat in Nha Trang. Good swimming holes are available in the stream at the bottom of the mountain, especially near the Foresty Inspection Station boom gate, 13km from the Suoi Cat turn off.", "suggested_duration": "",
