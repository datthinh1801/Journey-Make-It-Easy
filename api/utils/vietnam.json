It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. \n\nVisitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. \n\nThe Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.",

The building contains items of original furniture transported from the Dr Yersin Museum in Nha Trang, and reproductions of several period photographs. Entrance fee to the historical site is 30,000 dong. On site parking is free.Also on site are: an open sided canteen, and five small chalets for rent at 500,000 dong per night per couple (100,000 dong per additional guest). Electricity is available, but as yet is inexplicably not connected. Hence (1) the canteen menu is limited to dried fish, dried squid and fresh chicken, killed just for you. Tea, coffee, soft drinks and non-refigerated beer are available without ice; (2) the chalets are unheated and without hot water; and (3) small kerosene hurrican lamps are used for lighting.To get here, go 17km from Nha Trang towards Saigon, turn right at Suoi Cat commune at a blue and white tourist sign \"Ho Chua Nuoc Suoi Dau\", after one km and turn left a market onto the Hon Ba road. Follow this road 38km to Hon Ba peak.A visit to this site would suit history buffs and those just wishing an escape from summer heat in Nha Trang. Good swimming holes are available in the stream at the bottom of the mountain, especially near the Foresty Inspection Station boom gate, 13km from the Suoi Cat turn off.",

In 1935, its beauty and captivation persuaded people to once again name it after the most wonderful thing in the world: Love. Thanks to being the honeymoon destination of newly-married couples, this valley is even regarded as Niagara Fall of Vietnam. The Valley of Love today is located 4 miles away from the center of Dalat, the little Paris, on Phu Dong Thien Vuong St.",

With private pools and secluded gardens outside each and every one of our spacious thatched villas, plus a stunning beachfront, mouth-watering dining options, a \u201cbreakfast anywhere, anytime\u201d concept, and a premium spa facility offering Fusion\u2019s unique \u201call-spa inclusive\u201d service, it really is the kind of place to disconnect, switch off, and put the rest of the world on hold for a few days or weeks at a time. Located in a private bay in the north of one of Vietnam\u2019s most breathtaking tropical islands, with both ocean and river-front views, Fusion Resort Phu Quoc is the ideal getaway for couples, families, and groups of friends looking for a down-to-earth five-star experience without the fuss and formalities of a traditional \u201cluxury\u201d hotel or resort. We\u2019ve got fun and games for the kids, an ocean-facing cocktail bar and a secluded adults-only pool for the grown-ups, plus an enormous infinity pool by the beach for all. Phu Quoc is famous for its freshly caught fish, so we\u2019ve also created one of the best seafood restaurants on the island.",
